# Swap
The idea behind this project is to give people an option to exchange products and services without money (barter).  

# Tech doc in user stories
As a user I open an app and write services I can offer. 

As a user I open an app and write services or products I am interested in.

As a user after finish profile with "I can offer" & "I am interested in" I can find people who offers services I am interested in. 

As an application I can chain people (more than two) who are interested in services offered by at least one in chain. 

# Inspired by
The idea to use barter with assist of the modern tech was heard by me from russian ex-oligarch Herman Sterligov during finance crisis in 2008. The idea of matching and chaining people together by their needs and offers has borrowed few things from dead Google project Schemer (https://gcemetery.co/google-schemer/)
